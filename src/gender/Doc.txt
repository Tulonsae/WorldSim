DESCRIPTION
    GenderType specifies an enum value for each of the available gender types
    and a special enum value that indicates the number of gender types.  The
    GENDER_SIZE is not recognized as a valid gender type by the functions.
    Its only purpose is to easily determine the number of valid gender types.

    The getGenderCode() function returns the code for the gender type.  This
    is a single letter and is intended for use by the persistent data store.
    An empty string is returned if an invalid gender type is passed into the
    function.
 
    The getGenderName() function returns a string for the gender type.  This
    is a single word and is intended for human readable reports and displays.
    An empty string is returned if an invalid gender type is passed into the
    function.

    The genGenderRandomly() function returns a randomly generated gender type
    of one of the following: GENDER_FEMALE, GENDER_MALE.
