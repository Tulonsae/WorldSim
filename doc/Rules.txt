Minimum viable population

  160 - size of a small village, could be as small as 80 with social
    engineering (source: Anthropologist John Moore from University of Florida)

  50/500 rule - short-term effective population of 50 is needed to prevent
    an unacceptable rate of inbreeding (1% per generation is acceptable);
    long-term population of 500 required to maintain overall genetic viability
    (source: Franklin and Soule)


Population Increase

  Conception depends on:
  - availability: fertile males, not being pregnant, how long since last
    birth or miscarriage (if any)
  - age: in addition to the fertility range, add percentage chance within
    the fertility range (with a mid point)
  - number of previous: pregnancies, miscarriages, children
  - fat: not enough food lowers the chance significantly
  - birth control: preventative methods, if available and used
  - other social factors: TBD

  * Possibly add in fertility strength of male?


Groupings

  The household unit is the basic economic unit.  This is an extended family
  model - husband + wife with children and "extra" family members, and possibly
  retainers, servants, employees, slaves.

  Household leadership is 1 or 2 people, usually the married couple.

  One married son inherits the household, or a married daughter if no
  (married) sons.  Parents remain in household until death, with leadership
  transferring to the son and his wife.  The other married sons and daughters
  leave to establish their own households.  Single sons and daughters become
  the "extras" of households or become retainers/employees/servants.

  Household size? possibly 15
